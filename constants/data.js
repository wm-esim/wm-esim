Often these small samples require the purchase of expensive, ultra-compact glass pH electrodes, and the UH1 provides the perfect solution by sampling dropwise or dipwise. *The UH2 offers sample volumes as low as 1 microliter.",

      "Helicobacter pylori is a type of tiny Gram-negative bacterium. It has a spiral shape and flagella, which allows it to move around in the gastric mucosa. The adhesive molecules on its surface can bind to receptors on the surface of gastric mucosal cells, helping them to attach to the gastric mucosa and avoid being washed away. These characteristics enable Helicobacter pylori to survive and colonize in the stomach environment, leading to infections and related stomach problems.",
